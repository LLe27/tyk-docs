Tyk comes with support for OpenID Connect Identity Tokens provided by any standards compliant OIDC provider.

Getting OIDC support in the Dashboard requires only a few fields to be set up in the Core settings tab. for details see [Setting up OIDC](https://site-dev.tykbeta.com/docs/advanced-configuration/integrate/api-auth-mode/open-id-connect/#setting-up-oidc) and a [worked example of using OpenID Connect with Auth0](/docs/advanced-configuration/integrate/api-auth-mode/oidc-auth0-example/).
