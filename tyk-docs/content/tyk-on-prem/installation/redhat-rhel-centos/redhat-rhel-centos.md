## Getting Started
1. clone the [tyk-ansible](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-ansible) repositry

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-ansible
```

2. `cd` into the directory
```.bash
$ cd tyk-ansible
```

3. Run initalization script to initialize environment

```bash
$ sh scripts/init.sh
```

4. Modify `hosts.yml` file to update ssh variables to your server(s). You can learn more about the hosts file [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html)

5. Run ansible-playbook to install the following:
- Redis
- MongoDB
- Tyk Dashboard
- Tyk Gateway
- Tyk Pump

```bash
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml -t tyk-pro -t redis -t mongodb
```

You can choose to not install Redis or MongoDB by removing the `-t redis` or `-t mongodb` respectively. However Redis and MongoDB are a requirment and need to be installed for the Tyk Pro to run.

## Install Tyk Pro on Red Hat (RHEL) / CentOS

Installing Tyk on RHEL is very straightforward using our YUM repositories, follow the guides and tutorials in this section to have Tyk up and running in no time.

The suggested order would be to install Tyk Dashboard, then Tyk Pump and then Tyk Gateway for a full stack.

- [Dashboard](/docs/getting-started/installation/with-tyk-on-premises/redhat-rhel-centos/dashboard/)
- [Pump](/docs/getting-started/installation/with-tyk-on-premises/redhat-rhel-centos/analytics-pump/)
- [Gateway](/docs/getting-started/installation/with-tyk-on-premises/redhat-rhel-centos/gateway/)

**Note**  

For a production environment, we recommend that the Gateway, Dashboard and Pump are installed on separate machines. If installing multiple Gateways, you should install each on a separate machine. See [Planning for Production](/docs/planning-for-production/) For more details.
