There are two main ways to install your Tyk Self-Managed installation in a Kubernetes cluster - via Helm charts and via Kubernetes manifest files.

### Tyk Helm Charts

We will explain in detail the installation using [Helm Charts]({{< ref "/content/tyk-on-prem/installation/kubernetes/helm-chart.md" >}})
since itâ€™s the most common way to install in Kubernetes.

### Kubernetes manifest files

The repository to install via Kubernetes manifest files is currently [inactive](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-k8s) 
but you can get advice and support via the support team or the [community forum](https://community.tyk.io/).

## Tyk Operator and Ingress 

For a GitOps workflow used with a Tyk Self-managed installation or setting the Tyk Gateway as an Kubernetes ingress controller, 
see our [Tyk Operator](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator) repo.
