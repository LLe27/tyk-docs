Tyk offers many open source products which integrate with the Gateway. It is an open source Enterprise API Gateway supporting REST, GraphQL, TCP and gRPC protocols.
You can use as many or as few as you need to solve your API problems.

Our commitment to open source also delivers a host of benefits for our users: signup for free with Tyk, receive securely packaged open source packages, getting started guides, access to our community and all of the latest open source information.

You can sign up for a free trial to test it out [free trial](https://tyk.io/sign-up/).
