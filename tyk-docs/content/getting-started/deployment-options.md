Tyk comes in three flavours: Cloud, On-Premises and Community Edition. Each has its own strengths and reasons for deployment.

- [New Tyk Cloud](/docs/tyk-cloud/): Our new, next level SaaS installation.
- [Tyk On-Premises](/docs/tyk-on-premises/): A full Tyk stack in your own infrastructure, it doesn't call home, it's all yours and you can do with it what you like. This is the most flexible Tyk deployment you could have.
- [Tyk Community Edition](/docs/tyk-oss-gateway/): The backbone of all our products is our open source Gateway. You can install our Community Edition (Gateway only),  supported by our community members and advocates (with some help from the Tyk Technologies team).
