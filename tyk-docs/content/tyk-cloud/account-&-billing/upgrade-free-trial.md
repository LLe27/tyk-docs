## Introduction

This page explains how you can upgrade your free trial of Tyk Cloud to a full account, to continue enjoying the benefits of Tyk Cloud.

## My free trial is coming to an end. What are my options?

Every new Tyk Cloud account is assigned to our 14 free trial. You have the following options:

* Upgrade to a paid plan at any stage of the free trial period.
* Use the free trial period and upgrade after it expires

## What happens if my free trial expires?

If your free trial ends without you upgrading, your account enters what we call [retirement](/docs/account-billing/retirement/).

## What does Upgrading a Free Trial account involve?

To upgrade your free trial, you (as a Billing Admin) need to:

* Add a [payment method](/docs/account-billing/add-payment-method/) to your organisation
* Select a new [plan](/docs/account-billing/plans/) from our list
