You'll now look at the analytics for the API you created in [Task 5](/docs/tyk-cloud/getting-started-tyk-cloud/first-api/).

## Step One - Access the Dashboard

From the Deployments Overview screen Click **Access Dashboard**. You'll be redirected to the Tyk Dashboard for your [Control Plane](/docs/tyk-cloud/glossary/glossary/#control-plane). You can see the successful calls made to your API from the two Edges you created.

## Step Two - Create an Error

From either Edge, make a call that will throw an error. For example, use `me-app` instead of `my-app`. You should see the error displayed in the Analytics.
