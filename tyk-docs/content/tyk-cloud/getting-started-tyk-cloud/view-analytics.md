## Introduction

You can use Tyk Cloud to manage your APIs effectively and with minimal effort. This page walks you through the Tyk Cloud analytics process, so that you can ensure your APIs are performing perfectly. 

## Step One - Access the Dashboard

You'll now look at the analytics for the API you created in [Task 5](/docs/tyk-cloud/getting-started-tyk-cloud/first-api/).

From the Deployments Overview screen Click **Access Dashboard**. You'll be redirected to the Tyk Dashboard for your [Control Plane](/docs/tyk-cloud/glossary/glossary/#control-plane). You can see the successful calls made to your API from the two Edges you created.

## Step Two - Create an Error

From either Edge, make a call that will throw an error. For example, use `me-app` instead of `my-app`. You should see the error displayed in the Analytics.
