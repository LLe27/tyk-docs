## Introduction

You can use Tyk Cloud to manage your APIs effectively and with minimal effort. Part of that process involves setting up a team. This page walks you through how to do so.

Click **Get Started** to create your team

## Step One - Name your Team

Name your [team](/docs/tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-support/glossary/#team). You may find it useful to reflect the names used within your organazation.

## Step Two - Invite your Users

Invite your [users](/docs/tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-support/glossary/#user) to your team. You'll only need their email address and which of the available [roles](/docs/tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-support/glossary/#role) you want to assign to them.

Out of the box, the following roles are setup:

* **Team member**. They can manage deployment activity for the team they are added to.
* **Team admin**. They can manage deployment activity and users for the team they are added to.
* **Organisation admin**. They can manage deployment activity and users for a single organisation.

Next you'll create an environment.
