Getting started with Tyk-Cloud involves you setting up the following:

* Creating your account
* Your first Organisation
* Creating your first team
* Configuring and deploying your Environment

At the end of this process you will have a simple API set up via a Tyk Dashboard and you'll see analytics for this API on the Tyk Activity Dashboard.

Depending on your initial requirements in terms of Environments, Teams and Users, the setup process should take between 15 to 30 minutes.

## Prerequisites

The following information would be useful so you can set up Tyk-Cloud as quickly as possible:

* Team member information including their email address and the role you plan to assign to them.
* We have some specific terminology used within Tyk-Cloud. It would be useful to checkout our [Glossary](/docs/tyk-cloud/glossary/glossary/) so you understand what we are referring to.
