We've covered the following to get you started with the Tyk Cloud way of managing Tyk deployments

* We've created a new Organisation
* We've added a team and added members with associated roles to it
* We've added an Environment, incuding a Control Plane Dashboard and an associated Edge Gateway and deployed them
* We've added a very simple API to the Control Plane Dashboard and tested it via the first Edge Gateway
* We've added a second Edge Gateway and tested the API via that Gateway
* We've seen the data from the Gateways displayed in the Analytics section of the Control PLane Dashboard

We have actually only scratched the surface of what is possible with Tyk Cloud.

What to go through next:

* Mangaging your Deployments
* Adding [Plugins and Middleware](/docs/tyk-cloud/using-plugins/using-plugins/) to your Control Plane
