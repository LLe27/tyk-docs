## Introduction

This page explains what a Tyk Cloud org admin can do as part of your API management process, giving you complete control over your API management.

As an Org Admin, your role allows you to manage the following:

* [Environments](/docs/tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-support/glossary/#environment)
* Deployments (Control Planes, Edges)
* [Teams](/docs/tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-support/glossary/#team) and team members
* Plugins

## Org Admin Overview Screen

When you log in you will see the Overview screen for the Organisation you are connected to. This screen displays the following info:

* Quick Stats
* Teams added to your Organisation
* Deployments
* Environments

### Quick Stats

![Quick Stats](/docs/img/admin/org_admin_quick_stats.png)

The Quick Stats section gives you a "at a glance" overview of your organisation. This section is designed to show what your plan entitles your organisation to and how much of your entitlement is currently used in relation to Teams, Control Planes, Edge Deployments and the distribution of those deployments across the available entitlement regions.

### Teams

![Teams](/docs/img/admin/org_admin_teams.png)

This section shows the number of teams created within the organisation, the number of environments the team is assigned to, and the active deployments within those environments.

### Deployments

The default view for this section is Group by Control Plane.
